# Product Highlights & Benefits

## Solve coding problems faster with Copilot Chats
#### Introducing Copilot Chats, an advanced feature of our Azure Data Studio Extension, crafted to seamlessly integrate with your unique development workflow. The Pieces Copilot is not just a tool; it's a workflow assistant that adapts to your style, learning from your interactions to provide highly personalized, context-aware assistance.
#### Powered by on-device machine learning, as well as your choice of local and cloud-based LLMs (i.e. Llama 2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and PaLM 2), Pieces Copilot offers a blend of coding efficiency, accuracy, and personalized support that understands the nuances of your work, enhancing your coding experience irrespective of the task complexity.
- ### Contextualized and Continuous Learning
  #### Pieces Copilot excels in offering highly contextualized support. By analyzing your codebase and interactions in real-time, it delivers tailored suggestions, code optimization tips, and contextually generated code, all based on your unique coding patterns and project requirements.
  #### Pieces Copilot leverages user-defined contexts, such as local files, folders, and snippets, for code generation and interactive assistance. Set your context as chat messages, specific repositories, or saved code snippets to ensure that Copilot's support is precisely aligned with your needs.


- ### Local and Cloud-Based LLMs (Llama 2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and PaLM 2)
  #### From the start, everything we build at Pieces is designed with utmost security and privacy in mind. We believe that your data is yours, and we are committed to keeping it that way. As a result, you can choose between local and cloud-based LLMs, depending on your security needs and preferences.
  #### Currently, we have available Llama 2 to run either on your device's CPU or GPU, and GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and PaLM 2 to run via the cloud. We are continuously working on expanding our LLM offerings, so stay tuned for more updates!
  > #### Local LLM Recommendations
  > - GPU LLMs are designed for machines with a modern, dedicated
  graphics chip (i.e: ARM Mac, NVIDIA GPU with 6gb VRAM or more)
  > - CPU models are recommended if you do not have a strong enough
  graphics card for the GPU LLMs. Be aware this model will be as slow or
  as fast as your machine specs allow. 
  > - CLOUD models are recommended if performance issues arise while
  using the local models (for older or lower powered machines).

## Saving Useful Developer Materials
#### Pieces for Developers was built from the ground up to serve as a centralized place to save all types of materials and resources related to a developer's work-in-progress journey.
#### Code snippets, scratch files,  screenshots, UML diagrams, links, and more. Paste something from your clipboard, drag & drop, or save it directly in IDE via our plugins.

- ### Stay in Flow with Single-Click Save
  #### We are making a continuous effort to provide our users with frictionless ways to save key workflow materials. Stay in the flow with our **[Azure Data Studio Extension]** and simply select a code snippet or a resource in your file tree, right-click, and select "Save to Pieces".
  #### Save all types of resources. It's better to have a resource available and not need it than need it and not have it!
  > - **i.e. Boilerplate/Reference Snippets, Common Bash/Powershell Commands, CI/CD Configurations, HTTP Requests, Screenshots, Architecture/UML Diagrams, Text Notes, and so much more.**

  

- ### Proactive Save and Pattern Engine
  #### It's often the case that you only realize you should have saved a resource at the moment you realize you didn't save it. To help with this phenomenon our **[Azure Data Studio Extension]** learns from your workflow behaviors and can proactively save things for you.
  #### Our offline-first and on-device Pattern Engine runs in the background and can pick up on your workflow patterns, recognize snippets that you’re frequently reusing; and from there, if you don’t have similar snippets already saved, our platform will automatically save these high-reuse snippets for you.

  

- ### In-Project Snippet Discovery
  #### **[Pieces for Developers]** is the first developer tool in the world to ingest an entire code base and return hyper-specific, highly-reusable code snippets entirely offline and on-device.
  #### Running **[Snippet Discovery]** on a local source repository has huge benefits:
  - **Discover highly reusable snippets resulting in less time spent re-writing the same code from scratch over and over**
  - **Driving code standardization within and across projects**
  - **Discover reference snippets and share them with your team or use them to onboard new developers faster than ever**

  

## Context Awareness Engine, Useful Metadata, and AI Auto-Enrichment
#### When you save something to **[Pieces for Developers]** it not only saves the material itself; but further, our [Context Awareness Engine] automatically attaches related context & metadata enabling powerful organization, search, and suggestion capabilities.

- ### Origin Details
  #### Reference code is everywhere these days, whether it's a solution that you're adapting from Stack Overflow or doc-site boilerplate sent over Slack or Microsoft Teams, all code comes from somewhere.
  #### Where a code snippet came from, and the larger context it was taken out of, is often lost when saving or sharing reference materials today and makes it incredibly difficult to find and share or reuse it later on.
  #### In an effort to maintain this invaluable context, Pieces for Developers automatically extracts and associates useful origin details every time you save a resource.
  > **i.e. Project Name, Source File, Line Numbers, Collaborators, Solution Publishers, Application Source, etc.**

  

- ### AI-Generated Smart Descriptions and Associated Commit Messages
  #### Between our **[Flagship Desktop App]**, **[Chromium-Based Browser Extension]**, and the **[Azure Data Studio Extension]**, our users are saving more than ever. That said, a large part of our material enrichment efforts are allocated towards making searches and suggestions first-class.
  #### With these end goals in mind, Pieces for Developers ships with an offline and on-device ML Material Description model that generates a smart description for everything you save:
  - **i.e. What the code snippet or resource is, what it does, how to use it, and how it might be used in the future.**
  #### These smart descriptions, coupled with relevant commit messages extracted via our Context Awareness Engine, enable awesome reference and reuse experiences later on in a users' workflow.
  

- ### Related Links, External Resources & Reference Materials
  #### More and more developer resources live online nowadays. Saving links you found while researching or problem-solving in the browser, code, or documentation has never been easier.
  #### With Pieces for Developers you can quickly associate URLs to external resources such as Documentation Pages, Wiki Links, Jira Tickets, Pull Requests, GitHub Issues, you name it, with your saved materials.

  


- ### AI-Generated Smart Labels and User Added Tags
  #### Doubling down on our efforts to make search and suggestion world-class, Pieces for Developers ships with an offline and on-device ML Material Labeling model that automatically generates smart labels for everything you save:
  - **i.e. “HTTP Request”, “Flutter Framework”, "Dart Project", "Conditional For Loop"**
  #### In addition to our auto-generated smart labels, our Context Awareness Engine automatically layers in tags corresponding to origin details and related links.
  #### Lastly, you can easily add your own tags as a manual way to further organize your saved resources while driving a more personalized search and suggestion experience.
  


- ### Related People
  #### These days technical work is more people-centric than ever. Writing and reviewing code, upskilling on ever-evolving best practices, migrating to new framework versions, and onboarding new developers, it all builds on the work of others.
  #### Simply knowing who to reach out to for additional context, who to add as a reviewer on pull requests, or who might provide a different perspective could save some serious time and prevent major headaches.
  #### To help solve this dilemma, our Context Awareness Engine automatically associates Relevant Collaborators, Maintainers, and Content Authors with the resources you save.
  

- ### Smart Warnings and Sensitive Information Detection
  #### Some of the most commonly saved snippets are Powershell and Command Line instructions, boilerplate for unit tests, .env variables, HTTP requests and CI/CD build configs.
  #### All of these often contain sensitive data like API keys, auth tokens, usernames, passwords, or service account credentials.
  #### Pieces for Developers facilitates security and programming best practices by detecting sensitive information and warning against accidental uploads or sharing.
  

## Global Search, Sort via Suggestions, Reference and Reuse Saved Materials
#### Pieces for Developers ships with a first-in-kind TLP Query Engine built to efficiently run entirely on-device. Search and Suggestion results rank on a blend of code similarity, recent activity, tags, descriptions, people, related links, and more.

- ### In-Editor Global Search with the Command Palette
  #### Our Azure Data Studio Extension makes it easier than ever to find what you need when you need it with a blazing-fast search experience right inside your editor.
  #### Instantly find, reference, share or reuse your saved developer materials in a few keystrokes without breaking your flow.
  

- ### Fine-tune Global Search with **Result Display Modes & Sort Preferences**
  #### Not able to find what you're looking for? Try out our different Global Search Preferences.
  #### As a result of automatic material enrichment there is a bunch of helpful metadata associated with each saved material. With that, you can mix and match different search preferences and result display modes in a way that best matches your search style.

  


- ### Reuse Saved Materials with **Atomic Auto-Complete**
  #### From the Language Servers that ship with Azure Data Studio, to the recent variety of LLM offerings like GitHub Co-Pilot and TabNine, there are already plenty of great options for auto-completing code.
  #### With this in mind and leveraging our on-device Pattern Engine, we wanted to take a complementary approach to these existing systems.
  #### Our goal isn't to auto-complete from all possibilities, in all scenarios; but more specifically, auto-complete from your saved code snippets, in scenarios where it makes the most sense.
  - **i.e. Creating a new file from saved boilerplate, writing unit tests, or integrating marketing scripts such as Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel Tags.**

  

- ### **Explore Snippets** with Pieces Insights
  #### Exploring Materials with Pieces Insights allows you to learn more about a code snippet without saving it to your repository.
  #### To revisit explored materials, check out the new section titled “Explored Materials & Snippet Insights” in the Extension Tree View. Here, you can view your explored materials, save them to Pieces, or delete them— just right-click. If you’d like to automatically save your explored materials to your Pieces repository, toggle on “Explore and Save” in your extension settings.

  

- ### **Document Snippets** with Pieces Insights
  #### If you love the Pieces autogenerated explainations of your snippets, you can automatically insert those descriptions as comments above the explored material into your code! By default, the Pieces for Azure Data Studio Extension will automatically add comments of the description above your Explored Materials. To turn this off, uncheck “Document with Pieces Insights” in the Extension settings.

  

- ### Sorting with Realtime and Scope-Relevant Suggestions
  #### The demands on developers are increasing every day. As a result, a developer's time is becoming ever more precious and anything that boosts productivity is no longer a nice-to-have, but a need-to-have.
  #### With that, our team has invested serious resources enabling Pieces for Developers to proactively suggest the most relevant materials at the right time.
  #### Complementing **[Proactive Save and Pattern Engine]** in the **[Azure Data Studio Extension]**, we're excited to for you to check out **[Sorting via Suggestions]**, which is based on your recently saved materials, available in our **[Flagship Desktop App]**.

  

- ### Accessing Saved Material Overviews from the In-IDE List View
  #### In addition to **[Global Search]**, **[Scope-Relevant Suggestions]**, and **[Atomic Auto-Complete]**, we wanted to make it easy to view and access all of your saved materials, and their associated metadata, directly from within your IDE.
  #### When you install the Azure Data Studio Extension a tool tab with the Pieces logo is added to the left-hand side of Azure Data Studio. This is where you can view all of your saved resources; further, open them for referencing in a generated **[Material Overview Markdown]**, and sign in to set up your private cloud for sharing.

  


- ### Pick-up where you left-off with the Workflow Activity Stream
  #### Picking up where you left off and getting back into flow is one of the largest productivity bottlenecks throughout a developer's workflow. So, our team has been hard at work making it easier than ever to backtrack through your work-in-progress journey.
  #### Our **[Workflow Activity Stream and Process Backtracking]** enable you to quickly find and access useful context metadata that's been associated with your saved materials. Workflow details and points of reference such as related links, shared snippets, relevant tags, collaborators, and more are all available as a scrollable timeline right within our **[Flagship Desktop App]**.

  

- ### Find Related Materials
  #### Sometimes you know you’ve saved a helpful snippet to your current project, but you can’t remember exactly what it is. By using Pieces to find Related Materials, you can easily discover the snippet you were looking for, or a different, equally useful snippet.
  #### Highlight some code in your editor, right-click, and select “Find Related Materials in Pieces.” Pieces will search your saved snippets and display any related materials in the Side Panel, so that you can easily add them to your project.

  


## Personalized Link-Sharing of Saved Materials and Their Context Metadata
#### Developers, Technical Writers, Instructors, and many others in the space are constantly having to share code snippets, error logs, configuration files, boilerplate, sample code, and other developer materials with their colleagues, content readers, students, open-source maintainers, customers, and so on.
#### For us, sharing is not only about sending someone the code snippet or resource itself, but further, enabling the recipient to access both the material and its associated context metadata - where it came from, what it is, why it was saved, its description, git context, tags, additional collaborators, related links, and so much more.


- ### Select, Right-Click & Link-Share Directly in Your IDE
  #### Effortlessly share code snippets, screenshots, and other resources with a personalized access link _i.e._ **_YOUR_USERNAME.pieces.cloud_**_,_ in just a few steps. When you select a resource within your IDE and generate a shareable link, that resource along with all of its useful context gets uploaded to your private Pieces for Developers Cloud.
  #### From there, those with the link will be able to access what you shared and its context metadata, even if the recipient doesn't have Pieces for Developers themselves.
  - **Preview this [Shared Python Snippet] from [python.pieces.cloud] in your browser, which is one of twenty useful snippets in our _[Curated Python Snippets Collection]_**
  #### Further, if you edit the resource or add additional context metadata [Pieces for Developers] will recommend that you update the link or automatically update it for you. This happens in the background without generating a new access link meaning previous recipients can stay up to date, and you don't have to re-share.
  #### Lastly, we know that accidental shares happen and permission levels can change. With that, you can always revoke a shareable link at any time.

  

- ### Saving a Shared Material for Offline Reuse from the Pieces for Developers ⎸ Sharing Preview Web App
  #### Although it's not needed to have [Pieces for Developers] installed when accessing a shared resource, we don't want our users having to switch back and forth to the browser or needing to keep track of all the share links you've received.
  #### For recipients that have [Pieces for Developers] installed, they can easily save a copy of the shared resource to their own [Pieces for Developers] drive for offline search, suggestion, and reuse later on.
  #### Simply click the **_Save to Pieces_** button located at the top of the Sharing Preview Web App, and you're good to go! You can now access and reuse the locally saved resource in our [Flagship Desktop App] or directly in your IDE with the [Azure Data Studio Extension].

# Additional Features and Benefits
#### Believe it or not, this document simply scratches the surface of what the entire [Pieces for Developers] product lineup has to offer, and being just over a year into the journey, we're only getting started.
#### Nevertheless, here are some additional features and capabilities that are enabled with the [Pieces for Developers | Azure Data Studio Extension]

- ### Inserting a saved Code Snippet at your current cursor location
  #### When you're ready to re-use a snippet, we offer a variety of ways to quickly access and insert snippets into your active file. In addition to **[Atomic Auto-Complete]** or **[Global Search]**(#global-search-sort-via-suggestions-reference-and-reuse-saved-materials) using the command palette, users also enjoy the ability to insert a saved snippet at their cursor location via right-clicking on the snippet in the List View.

  

- ### Editing saved Code Snippets and Text Notes
  #### As we progress deeper into our projects, frameworks, and dependencies often change, which means we might need to adjust a saved snippet to comply with breaking changes or conform to new standards. Right-click on a snippet in the List View and select "Edit" to quickly and easily edit a saved snippet so your code can stay relevant and up-to-date.

  

- ### Renaming a Saved Material
  #### We're on a mission to make it as frictionless as possible for our users to save snippets without disrupting their flow. AI in Pieces for Developers will attempt to add a relevant name for your snippets automatically, so you don't have to. Don't worry, you can rename your snippets anytime to a convention that works best for you. All you need to do is right-click a snippet in the List View and select "Rename".

  

- ### Reclassifying a Code Snippets' Language Association
  #### When you save a material to Pieces for Developers, our AI works hard to understand what you saved so that we can successfully add as much helpful metadata - tags, related links & websites, related people - as possible.
  ####  One of our fundamental capabilities is Instant Language Detection, which automatically detects the language of your snippet and supports over 50 programming languages including Typescript, Javascript, Python, Dart, C++, C#, and many more. Unfortunately, we don't always get it right, so we made it as easy as possible to reclassify a snippet to the proper language. Simply right-click a snippet in the List View and select "Reclassify".

- ### Deleting a Saved Material
  #### Since we made it so simple to save snippets from the [**browser**], your IDE, and using our [Flagship Desktop App], users are saving hundreds of snippets throughout their time researching, coding, and collaborating. For some, this can get a little chaotic. If you find yourself looking to do a little spring-cleaning, you can delete snippets by right-clicking a snippet in the List View and selecting "Delete".

- ### Connecting Custom Cloud Domain
  #### Sharing materials using Pieces for Developers is about more than sharing the material itself. It's about sharing the material and all the contextual metadata associated with it - where it came from, what it does, how to use, associated people, and more. What's unique about our shareable links and sharing with Pieces for Developers is all of our users receive their own, dedicated cloud, isolated from other users.
  #### As a result, you can _personalize your cloud domain_ with a custom name, like _**https://mack.pieces.cloud**_. Now, when you generate and share a link, your link will include your personalized domain, so users know exactly who it came from.
  #### See this [Shared Python Snippet] from [python.pieces.cloud] in your browser. Notice this is from the custom domain, "python".
  #### To personalize your cloud domain, open the **[Pieces for Developers | Desktop App]** and navigate to the settings menu.
  > ##### Important Note:
  > - #### Updating your personal cloud domain can take up to 15 minutes for the new domain to go live. Don't worry, we will notify you when this is complete.
