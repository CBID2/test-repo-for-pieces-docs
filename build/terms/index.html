<p>Informal Resolution. Before filing a legal claim against Pieces, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting <a href="mailto:support@pieces.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@pieces.app</a>. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you may bring a formal claim.</p>
<p>Judicial Forum for Disputes. Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, you and Pieces agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to this Agreement or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of Ohio, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Pieces consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CAREFULLY! THEY MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>U.S. RESIDENTS AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</p>
<p>Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Pieces agree to resolve any claims relating to the Agreement or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>
<p>Arbitration Procedures. Arbitration is a less formal procedure than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. AAA’s rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org</a>. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, Ohio, or another mutually agreed-upon location.</p>
<p>Arbitration Costs. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Pieces will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines that the claim is frivolous. Pieces will not seek its attorneys&#x27; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that the claim is frivolous.</p>
<p>Opt-Out Procedure. YOU CAN REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (“OPT-OUT”) BY EMAILING US AT <a href="mailto:SUPPORT@PIECES.APP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SUPPORT@PIECES.APP</a> WITHIN 30 DAYS OF FIRST REGISTERING YOUR ACCOUNT AND PROVIDING US WITH YOUR NAME, EMAIL ADDRESS, AND A CLEAR STATEMENT SHOWING YOUR INTENT TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, IF YOU AGREED TO A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THESE TERMS THAT ALLOWED YOU TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOUR PREVIOUS CHOICE TO OPT-OUT OR NOT OPT-OUT REMAINS BINDING.</p>
<p>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Pieces may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Ohio or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Ohio to resolve your claim.</p>
<p>No Class Actions. YOU AND PIECES AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS HELD UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE DEEMED VOID.</p>

<p>Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, these Terms will be governed by Ohio law without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>Survival</p>
<p>All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, dispute resolution, controlling law, and limitations of liability.</p>

<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Pieces with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes and replaces any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, oral or written, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of Pieces, or by the posting by Pieces of a revised version. This Agreement creates no third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<p>Pieces’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. You may not assign any of your rights under this Agreement, and any such attempt will be void. Pieces may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>

<p>Pieces reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms at any time and we will update these Terms in the event of any such amendments. We will notify you of material changes to this Agreement via a notification in the Services or by sending email to the primary email address specified in your Pieces account. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you. If you do not agree to the updates, please cancel your Pieces account and stop using the Services before the updates become effective. Your continued use of the Services after those 30 days constitutes your agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Services constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms.</p>
